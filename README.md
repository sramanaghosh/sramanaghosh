# Hi, I'm Sramana Ghosh! 👋

I am a Graduate Student specializing in Deep Learning. I focus on understanding the "black box" of AI by building complex architectures from the ground up using NumPy.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 📊 [Deep Learning Foundations](https://github.com/sramanaghosh/Deep-Learning-from-Scratch-MNIST)
Built a modular neural network library. Achieved **95%+ accuracy** on MNIST using backpropagation and custom optimization.

### 🖼️ [Computer Vision & CNNs](https://github.com/sramanaghosh/CNN-Architecture-Implementation)
Implemented vectorized `Conv2D` and `MaxPool2D` layers. Built **LeNet-5** and **Mini-VGG** to classify CIFAR-10 images.

### ✍️ [NLP & Attention Mechanisms](https://github.com/sramanaghosh/RNN-Transformer-NLP-Scratch)
Developed sequence models from scratch, including **LSTMs, GRUs, and Multi-Head Attention**. 

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, SQL
- **AI/ML:** NumPy, Matplotlib, Neural Network Fundamentals
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub
